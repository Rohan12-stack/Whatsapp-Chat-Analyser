27/02/25, 22:36 - Gunashree: Objective and Motivation

There are several areas where emotion recognition techniques are used, like in digital cameras to automatically take pictures when the user smiles.

However, the most promising applications involve the humanization of artificial intelligent systems. If computers are able to keep track of the mental state of the user, robots can react upon this and behave appropriately. Emotion recognition, therefore, plays a key role in improving human-machine interaction.

Focusing on the objective, using a neural network-based artificially intelligent system capable of deriving the emotion of a person through pictures of his or her face.

09/04/25, 23:29 - Rohan B: @919663957450 Tasks
1. Get reference for FER using both CNN and ViT model(in this ppt we r comparing these 2 model which is better), so u need to find ppts based on that 

2. Ppt design part is completely ur responsibility, so search in google, canva, presentation.ai, like these websites and try to build a good looking ppt


3. Ill send our research paper or report, make it plagiarism free


4. Search in youtube for a good 3d game using unity see the first part and last part so u have an idea how the game looks like when playing, if u find it well sent the youtube link in group
09/04/25, 23:32 - Gunashree: Okayy
09/04/25, 23:33 - Rohan B: @918799146002 Tasks

1. Help @919663957450 To make a ppt without tech error and content error, get more clarity on our problem statement(u can refer the research paper if u want) so u can help her create one

2. Try modifying the confusion matrix for better result (u can take ur time as its not a must now)

3. Search in youtube for a good 3d game using unity see the first part and last part so u have an idea how the game looks like when playing, if u find it well sent the youtube link in group
09/04/25, 23:35 - Rohan B: @919663957450 Task 4 and @918799146002 Task 3

10/04/25, 16:57 - Rohan B: @916364562073 here everything is there 
Unzip and learn ok, last moment i cant teach u
16 th is the final date
10/04/25, 17:06 - Rohith: Ok
10/04/25, 21:34 - Rohan B: @919663957450 I might need ur lap tomorrow
10/04/25, 21:35 - Rohan B: Either talk to appa and stay with me till 8 or 9

Or hand me ur lap

10/04/25, 21:40 - Gunashree: Ahh
10/04/25, 21:44 - Rohan B: 1. Give the lap and leave at 5
2. Be with me till appa comes and pick u, so u can take ur lap to home
3. U do the main part from home and leave early 

Choose ur option, im fine with all three
10/04/25, 22:16 - Nishita: For what you need ??

12/04/25, 10:22 - Gunashree: Yes, for this lab I have only made a single report
12/04/25, 10:22 - Gunashree: Yes I have mentioned all the topics in a single report
12/04/25, 10:22 - Gunashree: Thera is only two main topic shap and lime
12/04/25, 10:22 - Gunashree: ohh okay okay only this much is enough ryt
12/04/25, 10:22 - Gunashree: Yes
12/04/25, 10:22 - Gunashree: there is no need to do 6 records and all
12/04/25, 10:22 - Gunashree: I don't think so
12/04/25, 10:22 - Gunashree: <Media omitted>
12/04/25, 10:23 - Gunashree: i asked Yashwant like for the lab 9 should we prepare  lab records for each file and he sent this
12/04/25, 10:23 - Gunashree: soo can i also do this
12/04/25, 10:24 - Gunashree: or i should make lab records for each file
12/04/25, 10:25 - Nishita: As you think but it mentions only about 2 things only not the other activities
12/04/25, 10:26 - Nishita: We have done for text and something else also
12/04/25, 10:26 - Gunashree: how u did records for each file u done??
12/04/25, 10:26 - Nishita: Not yet still doing 
Yashwant had assigned some work so I was doing that
12/04/25, 10:26 - Nishita: Where are you??
12/04/25, 10:26 - Gunashree: lh4
12/04/25, 10:27 - Gunashree: sorry LH3
12/04/25, 10:27 - Nishita: U need laptop ??
12/04/25, 10:27 - Gunashree: illaa im doing but im confused how to do the record antahaa
12/04/25, 10:28 - Nishita: Like how we did for lab 4
12/04/25, 10:29 - Gunashree: ahh like part a .b. c d like taht till 6 files ryt
12/04/25, 10:32 - Nishita: Yess
12/04/25, 10:32 - Nishita: When will you the game ??
12/04/25, 10:38 - Rohan B: When im in the game😏
12/04/25, 10:39 - Nishita: Ayoo karma ve
12/04/25, 10:39 - Nishita: I am asking when will you do antha ?
12/04/25, 11:45 - Rohan B: Lets seeeeee

1. Remove plagiarism -@919663957450 have to do @918799146002 have to guide her 
2. @919663957450 Give me clarity regarding the lab work where we reached

NLP task:
1. Creating report - I will do the report, @918799146002  review it and tell me what and all should we include if any
2. Creating a project - I will do

ARVR tasks
1. Should create UI-@918799146002 Help me to create a UI the rest everything ill take care
13/04/25, 10:15 - Rohan B: I hope I've included everything, if not pls do let me know
13/04/25, 10:18 - Nishita: For plagiarism we need to check with small se tools ?? Or any other ??
13/04/25, 10:19 - Rohan B: Small se tool u try
I dont think it would be useful
Because we took everything from ai tool ryt
13/04/25, 10:19 - Rohan B: Small se helps to find from internet
13/04/25, 10:19 - Rohan B: We will try
13/04/25, 10:20 - Nishita: Then for the constitution we used that one ??
13/04/25, 10:20 - Rohan B: @919663957450 Put our research paper in both small se tool and zero gpt and take a ss analytics and sent in grp
13/04/25, 10:20 - Rohan B: Yeah
13/04/25, 11:54 - Gunashree: lab record till 8 everything finished ,,  lab 9 and 10 is left that's it
13/04/25, 11:55 - Gunashree: code file I will send u
13/04/25, 11:55 - Gunashree: 9 and 10
